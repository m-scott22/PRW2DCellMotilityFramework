2D in silico trajectory analysis

1. Use file 'PRW2Dsim.m' to generate in silico cell trajectories with specified parameter values. 
Specify S, P, dt and initial speed, positions and velocities along with number of cells and simulation periods.
Alternatively use the provided dataset PRW2Dsim1110001000.m where S=1, P=1, for 1000 cells and 1000 simulation 
periods of dt=0.05

2. Use the file 'normality.m' to conduct the Anderson-Darling test on velocities from full length tracks or all 
tracks at each time point and output a histogram of p values.

3. Use file 'fullanalysis2D.m' to carry out analysis of the cell tracks as in Figure 4 of the paper. This file can:
-plot trajectories
-plot the RMSS time series; estimate average cell speed parameter S with confidence interval
-compute ln(VACF); plot ln(VACF) vs time and a line of best fit; estimate persistence time parameter P with confidence interval
-plot histogram of speed distribution of all cell speeds at all times; overlay Maxwell-Boltzmann density function
-compute MSD; plot this with line of best fit and model predicted MSD
-plot speed distribution over the whole simulation time
